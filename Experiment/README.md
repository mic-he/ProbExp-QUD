# production study about context sensitivity of probability expressions

participants look at the content of an urn, read a question and select the most appropriate answer

the content of the urn is alway 10 balls, 'structured' in a either a dual configuration (n balls of one color, 10-n balls of another) or plural (n balls of one color, 10-n balls of as many different colors); n belongs to {0,3,4,5,10}

the question can either be polar (will a random ball be red?) or wh (which color will a random ball be?)

participants answer the question by filling in the gap in a message, clicking on one among four probability expressions (certainly not, probably not,probably, certainly)

manipulation of question is within participants; manipulation of urn configuration is within participants.
