    <h1>Phase 1</h1>
    
    <div class="instructions well">
        <p> In the first phase you play as receiver. You will have to decide if you want to bet or not.</p>
        <p> But how to decide? You will not be able to look inside the urn, but you can ask a question to the sender.</p>
        <p> We will use pictures to represent these situations. Here's an example:</p>
        <p align="left">
            <img src="/static/images/dots_question.png" height="264" width="343">
        </p>
        <p> Please look at the pictures in the following screens, and choose which question you want to ask.</p>
        <p> When you receive the answer, you can decide if you want to bet.</p>
