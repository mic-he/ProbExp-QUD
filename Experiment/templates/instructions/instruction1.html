    <div class="instructions well">
        <p> In the following screens we will offer a number of different bets to you.</p>
        <p> Betting always costs 1 credit. If you win a bet, you win 1 more credit.</p>
        <p> If you don't bet you don't lose anything (but you can't win either).</p>
        <p> For each bet, you can ask a question to the sender, then decide if/how you want to bet.</p>
        <p> Keep in mind that the sender wants to help you: bets and winnings are split between the two of you.</p>
        <p> You won't get any feedback during the game, but we'll keep track of your performance and give feedback at the end.</p>
