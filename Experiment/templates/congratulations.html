    <div class="instructions well">
        <p> You've been doing great so far!</p>
        <p> We can now move to the second phase, in which you will play several rounds as sender.</p>
        <p> Your job will be to help another player (the receiver) to place his or her bets.</p>
        <p> In each of the following screens you will read a question asked by the receiver, look inside the urn, and send your answer.</p>        
        <p> Please read the question carefully and answer in the way that seems most appropriate to you.</p>
        <p> Once again, we will keep track of your performance and give feedback at the end.</p>
